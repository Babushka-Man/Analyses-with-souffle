Do this for Even-ness and Positive-ness analyses: 
1. Define domain
2. Implement meet and join functions

### First steps:
1. Declare a relation consisting a single number
2. Declare another relation that classifies an action on two given numbers to a quality (e.g, evenness)

### Notes:

*  - has a lattice example
